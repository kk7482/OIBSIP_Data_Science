**OVERVIEW**
This repository contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models to classify iris species using the Iris dataset. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and used to train three different classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The accuracy of the models is reported, showcasing an improvement from approximately 95% to 100% accuracy after re-running.
**Introduction**
This project focuses on classifying iris species based on the well-known Iris dataset. By employing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees, the goal is to achieve accurate species classification.
**Results**
The accuracy of the models before re-running the project is around 95%. After re-running, the models achieve 100% accuracy. This improvement highlights the potential variability in model performance due to random initialization and data splitting.
